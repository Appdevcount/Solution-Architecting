Summary of Clean Architecture
API Layer:

Contains endpoints and request-response models.
Performs basic input validations.
Maps API DTOs to domain models and calls the application layer.

Application Layer:

Contains application services.
Performs business validations defined in the domain layer.
May use application DTOs and map them to domain models but avoided to avoid additional mapper for this transition
Contains interfaces for data access and external service calls.

Domain Layer:

Contains core models and business rules.
Defines enums and business constants.

Data Access Layer:

Implements data access interfaces (DAL layer).
Maps DAL return types/models to application layer models.

Service Layer :

Implements external service interfaces (services project layer).
Maps external service return types/models to application layer models.

Workflow
API Layer: Receives a request, validates input, maps API DTO to domain model, and calls the application layer.
Application Layer: Performs business validation, maps DTOs if necessary, and uses interfaces to interact with the service and Data access layers.
Domain Layer: Contains the core business logic and rules.
Data acces Layer: Implements data access interfaces, maps data models to application models, and provides necessary data to the application layer.
service Layer: Implements service interfaces for external api calls, maps external api models to application models, and provides necessary data to the application layer.

This structure ensures that your application adheres to the principles of clean architecture, keeping your business logic decoupled from the infrastructure and presentation layers.
