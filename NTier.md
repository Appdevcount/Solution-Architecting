# N-Tier Architecture Overview

N-tier architecture, also known as multi-tier architecture, divides an application into logical layers and physical tiers. Each layer has a specific responsibility, and they interact with each other to form a complete application.

## Common Layers

- Presentation Layer: Handles user interactions.
- Application Layer: Manages business logic and workflows.
- Business Logic Layer (BLL): Encapsulates core business rules.
- Data Access Layer (DAL): Manages data persistence and retrieval.
- Infrastructure Layer: Provides supporting services like logging and configuration.
- Common Layer: Contains shared utilities and helpers.

## Sample Use Case: Online Bookstore

Let's consider an online bookstore as a sample use case. Here's how the N-tier architecture would be applied:

### Presentation Layer

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Views: Render HTML pages for the user.
- ViewModels: Transfer data between the views and controllers.

### Application Layer

- Interfaces: Define contracts for services.
- Services: Implement business logic, such as processing orders.
- DTOs: Transfer data between layers.

### Business Logic Layer (BLL)

- Entities: Represent business objects like Book, Order, and Customer.
- Repositories: Provide methods to interact with the database.
- BusinessServices: Implement core business rules, such as calculating discounts.

### Data Access Layer (DAL)

- DbContexts: Manage database connections and transactions.
- Migrations: Handle database schema changes.
- Repositories: Implement data access methods.

### Infrastructure Layer

- Configurations: Manage application settings.
- Logging: Implement logging mechanisms.
- EmailServices: Handle email notifications.

### Common Layer

- Helpers: Provide utility functions.
- Extensions: Extend existing classes with additional methods.
- Constants: Define application-wide constants.

## Diagram

Here's a visual representation of the N-tier architecture for the online bookstore:

```
/src
/Presentation
  /Controllers
  /Views
  /ViewModels
  /wwwroot
/Application
  /Interfaces
  /Services
  /DTOs
/BusinessLogic
  /Entities
  /Repositories
  /BusinessServices
/DataAccess
  /DbContexts
  /Migrations
  /Repositories
/Infrastructure
  /Configurations
  /Logging
  /EmailServices
/Common
  /Helpers
  /Extensions
  /Constants

```

## Example Workflow

- User Browses Books: The user interacts with the Presentation Layer to browse books.
- Fetch Book Data: The Controller calls the Service in the Application Layer to fetch book data.
- Business Logic: The Service interacts with the Business Logic Layer to apply any business rules, such as filtering books by category.
- Data Access: The Business Logic Layer uses the Data Access Layer to retrieve book data from the database.
- Display Data: The data is passed back through the layers to the Presentation Layer, where it is displayed to the user.

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the application easier to manage, test, and extend.

Great question! In an N-tier architecture, it's common to organize the layers into separate projects within a single solution. This approach helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and makes the application more modular and maintainable. Here's how you might structure it:

### Solution Structure

Solution Name: OnlineBookstore

- Presentation Layer: [OnlineBookstore.Web](http://onlinebookstore.web/)
- Application Layer: OnlineBookstore.Application
- Business Logic Layer (BLL): OnlineBookstore.BusinessLogic
- Data Access Layer (DAL): OnlineBookstore.DataAccess
- Infrastructure Layer: OnlineBookstore.Infrastructure
- Common Layer: OnlineBookstore.Common

### Example Solution Explorer View

```
OnlineBookstore.sln
/OnlineBookstore.Web
  /Controllers
  /Views
  /ViewModels
  /wwwroot
/OnlineBookstore.Application
  /Interfaces
  /Services
  /DTOs
/OnlineBookstore.BusinessLogic
  /Entities
  /Repositories
  /BusinessServices
/OnlineBookstore.DataAccess
  /DbContexts
  /Migrations
  /Repositories
/OnlineBookstore.Infrastructure
  /Configurations
  /Logging
  /EmailServices
/OnlineBookstore.Common
  /Helpers
  /Extensions
  /Constants

```

### Benefits of Separate Projects

- Modularity: Each layer is encapsulated in its own project, making it easier to manage and develop independently.
- Reusability: Common components can be reused across different projects or solutions.
- Maintainability: Changes in one layer do not directly affect other layers, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
- Scalability: You can scale individual layers independently based on the application's needs.

### Example Workflow

- User Browses Books: The user interacts with the [OnlineBookstore.Web](http://onlinebookstore.web/) project.
- Fetch Book Data: The Controller in [OnlineBookstore.Web](http://onlinebookstore.web/) calls a Service in OnlineBookstore.Application.
- Business Logic: The Service interacts with BusinessServices in OnlineBookstore.BusinessLogic.
- Data Access: The BusinessServices use Repositories in OnlineBookstore.DataAccess to retrieve data.
- Display Data: The data is passed back through the layers to [OnlineBookstore.Web](http://onlinebookstore.web/), where it is displayed to the user.

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns and makes the application easier to manage, test, and extend.

## Simplified Architectures

In the N-tier architecture example I provided earlier, there are six layers: Presentation, Application, Business Logic, Data Access, Infrastructure, and Common. However, for simplicity, let's focus on 3-tier and 2-tier architectures.

### 3-Tier Architecture

A 3-tier architecture divides an application into three distinct layers:

- Presentation Layer: The user interface where users interact with the application.
- Application Layer: The business logic that processes user requests and communicates with the database.
- Data Layer: The database where information is stored and managed.

### Use Case: E-commerce Platform

### Presentation Layer:

- Web Interface: Users browse products, add items to the cart, and place orders.

### Application Layer:

- Order Processing: Handles business logic such as calculating totals, applying discounts, and managing inventory.

### Data Layer:

- Database: Stores product details, user information, and order history.

### Workflow:

- User selects a product and adds it to the cart (Presentation Layer).
- The application processes the order, calculates the total, and updates the inventory (Application Layer).
- The order details are saved in the database (Data Layer).

### 2-Tier Architecture

A 2-tier architecture consists of two layers:

- Presentation Layer: The user interface that interacts directly with users.
- Data Layer: The backend database that stores and retrieves information.

### Use Case: Simple Contact Management Software

### Presentation Layer:

- Desktop Application: Users input and retrieve contact information.

### Data Layer:

- Local Database: Stores contact details.

### Workflow:

- User enters a new contact in the desktop application (Presentation Layer).
- The contact information is directly saved in the local database (Data Layer).

## Architecture Diagrams

Here's a visual representation of both architectures:

### 3-Tier Architecture

```
/Presentation Layer
  /Web Interface
/Application Layer
  /Order Processing
/Data Layer
  /Database

```

### 2-Tier Architecture

```
/Presentation Layer
  /Desktop Application
/Data Layer
  /Local Database

```

### Summary

- 3-Tier Architecture: Separates the application into three layers, enhancing scalability, maintainability, and security. Ideal for complex applications like e-commerce platforms.
- 2-Tier Architecture: Combines the presentation and data layers, suitable for simpler applications with fewer users, such as contact management software.
