Here’s a **regenerated and detailed explanation** of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with **Clean Architecture**, followed by a **deeper dive into Onion Architecture**, including **domain exceptions**, **folder structures**, and **comparative benefits** — all in Markdown format.

# 🧠 Domain-Driven Design (DDD) + Clean Architecture

## 📘 Overview

**DDD** helps model complex business logic by focusing on the domain and its rules. **Clean Architecture** ensures separation of concerns and independence from frameworks, databases, and UI.

Together, they promote maintainability, scalability, and testability.

---

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Clean Architecture Layers

1. **Entities (Domain Layer)** – Core business logic and rules.
2. **Use Cases (Application Layer)** – Application-specific business rules.
3. **Interface Adapters (Presentation Layer)** – Controllers, presenters, gateways.
4. **Frameworks & Drivers (Infrastructure Layer)** – UI, DB, external APIs.

### 🔹 DDD Concepts

- **Entities** – Objects with identity.
- **Value Objects** – Immutable objects without identity.
- **Aggregates** – Cluster of domain objects treated as a unit.
- **Repositories** – Abstract access to aggregates.
- **Domain Services** – Business logic not naturally fitting in entities.
- **Application Services** – Coordinate domain objects to perform tasks.
- **Domain Exceptions** – Custom exceptions representing domain rule violations.

---

## 🛠️ Sample Use Case: E-Commerce Order Management

### Scenario

- A customer places an order.
- The system validates stock and calculates total.
- Applies business rules (e.g., discounts).
- Saves the order.

## 🧠 Where to Place Logic

| Type of Logic                  | Location                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Core Business Rules           | Domain Layer (Entities/Services) |
| Cross-Aggregate Business Logic| Domain Services                   |
| Application Workflow          | Application Services              |
| Validation (Business)         | Domain Layer                      |
| Validation (Input/UI)         | Application Layer or Presentation|
| Domain Exceptions             | Domain Layer (Exceptions folder) |

---

## ✅ When to Use Domain Services

Use **Domain Services** when:

- Logic involves multiple entities.
- Logic doesn’t naturally belong to a single entity.
- You need stateless operations on domain models.

Example: `OrderDomainService` to calculate discounts across multiple orders.

# 🧅 Onion Architecture

## 📘 Overview

**Onion Architecture** is a layered architecture that places the **domain model at the center**, with dependencies flowing inward.

---

## 🧩 Layers

1. **Core (Domain Layer)** – Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services, Domain Exceptions.
2. **Application Layer** – Use cases, DTOs, interfaces.
3. **Infrastructure Layer** – Repositories, external services.
4. **UI Layer** – Controllers, views.

---

## 🗂️ Folder Structure (Onion Architecture)

## 🧠 Domain Exceptions in Onion Architecture

Domain exceptions are placed in the **Core layer**, typically under:

```plaintext
Core/
└── Exceptions/
    └── DomainException.cs
```

These represent violations of domain rules, e.g., `InsufficientStockException`, `InvalidOrderStateException`.

---

## 🔄 Differences from Clean Architecture

| Aspect                  | Clean Architecture                  | Onion Architecture                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Focus                  | Independence from frameworks        | Domain-centric layering            |
| Layering               | Entities → Use Cases → Interfaces   | Domain → Application → Infra → UI |
| Dependency Rule        | Outer layers depend on inner layers | Same                               |
| Domain Placement       | One of the layers                   | Center of the architecture         |
| Exception Handling     | Domain exceptions in domain layer   | Domain exceptions in core layer    |

---

## 🎯 Benefits of Onion Architecture

- Strong domain focus.
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Easier testing and maintenance.
- Reduces coupling between layers.
- Domain model is truly independent.

---

## 🧪 Sample App Comparison

Both architectures can implement the same use case (Order Management), but:

- **Clean Architecture** emphasizes abstraction and independence from frameworks.
- **Onion Architecture** emphasizes the domain model as the core of the system.

---

Would you like me to generate a sample codebase or diagram for either architecture? Or recreate this in a specific language like C#, Java, or Python?



Let’s now **compare the Application Layer** in both **Clean Architecture** and **Onion Architecture** using **side-by-side code samples** for the same use case: **placing an order**.

---
You're absolutely right to question the placement of `IRepository` in the architecture. Let's clarify:

---

### ✅ **Should `IRepository` be in the Domain Layer in DDD?**

Yes, **in Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, the **repository interfaces (`IRepository`) belong in the Domain Layer**, because they represent **domain contracts** for accessing aggregates. The implementation of these interfaces, however, belongs in the **Infrastructure Layer**.

This separation ensures:
- The **Domain Layer** remains independent of infrastructure concerns.
- The **Application Layer** depends on abstractions, not implementations.

---

### 🔄 Let's regenerate the **complete Clean Architecture + DDD sample** with this correction.

We'll use a **simple domain: Order Management System**.

---

## 🧱 1. Domain Layer

### ✅ Entities

#### `Order.cs`
```csharp
public class Order
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; private set; }
    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; private set; } = new();
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; private set; }

    public Order(string customerName)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(customerName))
            throw new DomainValidationException("Customer name is required.");

        Id = Guid.NewGuid();
        CustomerName = customerName;
        CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    }

    public void AddItem(OrderItem item)
    {
        if (item == null) throw new DomainValidationException("Item cannot be null.");
        Items.Add(item);
    }

    public decimal TotalAmount() => Items.Sum(i => i.TotalPrice);
}
```

#### `OrderItem.cs`
```csharp
public class OrderItem
{
    public string ProductName { get; }
    public int Quantity { get; }
    public decimal UnitPrice { get; }

    public decimal TotalPrice => Quantity * UnitPrice;

    public OrderItem(string productName, int quantity, decimal unitPrice)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(productName))
            throw new DomainValidationException("Product name is required.");
        if (quantity <= 0) throw new DomainValidationException("Quantity must be greater than zero.");
        if (unitPrice <= 0) throw new DomainValidationException("Unit price must be greater than zero.");

        ProductName = productName;
        Quantity = quantity;
        UnitPrice = unitPrice;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Domain Exception

```csharp
public class DomainValidationException : Exception
{
    public DomainValidationException(string message) : base(message) { }
}
```

### ✅ Repository Interface (in Domain)

```csharp
public interface IOrderRepository
{
    Task AddAsync(Order order);
    Task<Order> GetByIdAsync(Guid id);
}
```

---

## 🧠 2. Application Layer

### ✅ DTOs

```csharp
public class CreateOrderRequest
{
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public List<OrderItemDto> Items { get; set; }
}

public class OrderItemDto
{
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal UnitPrice { get; set; }
}
```

### ✅ Use Case

```csharp
public class CreateOrderHandler
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repository;

    public CreateOrderHandler(IOrderRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task<Guid> HandleAsync(CreateOrderRequest request)
    {
        var order = new Order(request.CustomerName);

        foreach (var item in request.Items)
        {
            var orderItem = new OrderItem(item.ProductName, item.Quantity, item.UnitPrice);
            order.AddItem(orderItem);
        }

        await _repository.AddAsync(order);
        return order.Id;
    }
}
```

---

## 🗃️ 3. Infrastructure Layer

### ✅ Repository Implementation

```csharp
public class InMemoryOrderRepository : IOrderRepository
{
    private readonly List<Order> _orders = new();

    public Task AddAsync(Order order)
    {
        _orders.Add(order);
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task<Order> GetByIdAsync(Guid id)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(_orders.FirstOrDefault(o => o.Id == id));
    }
}
```

---

## 🌐 4. API Layer (FluentValidation + Minimal API)

### ✅ FluentValidation

```csharp
public class CreateOrderValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateOrderRequest>
{
    public CreateOrderValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.CustomerName).NotEmpty();
        RuleForEach(x => x.Items).SetValidator(new OrderItemValidator());
    }
}

public class OrderItemValidator : AbstractValidator<OrderItemDto>
{
    public OrderItemValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.ProductName).NotEmpty();
        RuleFor(x => x.Quantity).GreaterThan(0);
        RuleFor(x => x.UnitPrice).GreaterThan(0);
    }
}
```

### ✅ Minimal API Setup

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IOrderRepository, InMemoryOrderRepository>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<CreateOrderHandler>();
builder.Services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<CreateOrderValidator>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapPost("/orders", async (
    CreateOrderRequest request,
    CreateOrderHandler handler,
    IValidator<CreateOrderRequest> validator) =>
{
    var validationResult = await validator.ValidateAsync(request);
    if (!validationResult.IsValid)
        return Results.BadRequest(validationResult.Errors);

    var orderId = await handler.HandleAsync(request);
    return Results.Ok(orderId);
});

app.Run();
```

## 🧩 What is `IAggregateRoot` in DDD?

In **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, an **Aggregate Root** is the **main entity** that controls access to a group of related objects (called an **Aggregate**). The interface `IAggregateRoot` is often used as a **marker interface** to identify such entities.

### ✅ Purpose of `IAggregateRoot`

- **Defines boundaries** of an aggregate.
- Ensures **invariants** are maintained across related entities.
- Prevents external code from directly modifying child entities or value objects.
- Helps repositories know which entities they should persist.

---

### 📦 Example

Let’s say you have an `Order` aggregate:

```csharp
public class Order : IAggregateRoot
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; private set; }

    public void AddItem(OrderItem item) { /* business logic */ }
}
```

Here:
- `Order` is the **Aggregate Root**.
- `OrderItem` is a **child entity or value object**.
- Only `Order` should be persisted via the repository, not `OrderItem` directly.

---

### 🧠 Why Use a Marker Interface?

```csharp
public interface IAggregateRoot { }
```

This interface has **no methods**. It’s used to:
- **Tag** entities as aggregate roots.
- Help with **generic repository patterns**.
- Improve **code readability and structure**.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `IAggregateRoot` | Marker interface to identify aggregate roots |
| Aggregate Root | Entity that owns and controls a group of related objects |
| Aggregate | A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit |

---

Would you like a diagram showing how aggregates and aggregate roots relate to entities and value objects?

Great follow-up! Let's break this down clearly:

## 🧩 What is `IDomainEvent`?

`IDomainEvent` is typically an **interface** used to mark a class as a **Domain Event** in DDD. It doesn’t usually contain any logic—it's just a marker to help identify and handle domain events consistently.

### Example in C#:

```csharp
public interface IDomainEvent
{
    // Marker interface – no members
}
```

Any class that represents a domain event (like `OrderPlaced`) would implement this interface:

```csharp
public class OrderPlaced : IDomainEvent
{
    public Guid OrderId { get; }
    public DateTime PlacedAt { get; }

    public OrderPlaced(Guid orderId, DateTime placedAt)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
        PlacedAt = placedAt;
    }
}
```

---

## 🗂️ Where Do These Files Go in DDD + Clean Architecture?

In **Clean Architecture**, the structure is layered. Here's how you can organize domain events:

### 📁 `Core` or `Domain` Layer

This is where your **business logic** lives.

- **Entities**: Your domain models (e.g., `Order`)
- **Value Objects**
- **Aggregates**
- **Domain Events**:
  - `IDomainEvent` interface
  - Event classes like `OrderPlaced`
- **Repositories** (interfaces only)
- **Domain Services**

### 📁 `Application` Layer

This layer coordinates tasks and handles use cases.

- **Use Cases / Services**
- **Event Handlers** (e.g., `OrderPlacedHandler`)
- **DTOs**
- **Interfaces for external services**

### 📁 `Infrastructure` Layer

This layer contains implementations for things like:

- **Event Dispatchers**
- **Email Services**
- **Database Access**
- **Message Brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)**

### 📁 `Presentation` Layer

This is your UI layer (e.g., Web API, MVC, etc.).

## 🧭 Summary of Placement

| Component            | Layer         | Folder Example               |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| `IDomainEvent`       | Domain        | `Domain/Events`              |
| `OrderPlaced`        | Domain        | `Domain/Events`              |
| `Order` Aggregate    | Domain        | `Domain/Entities`            |
| `OrderPlacedHandler` | Application   | `Application/EventHandlers`  |
| Dispatcher/Bus       | Infrastructure| `Infrastructure/Messaging`   |

Would you like a visual diagram of this folder structure or a sample project layout in GitHub-style?

Excellent question! Let's go deeper into how **Domain Events** are implemented and utilized in **DDD with Clean Architecture**, focusing on the role of `IDomainEventHandler`.

---

## 🧩 What is `IDomainEventHandler`?

`IDomainEventHandler<T>` is an **interface** that defines how to handle a specific domain event. It’s part of the **Application Layer** and helps decouple the event from its handling logic.

### Example in C#:

```csharp
public interface IDomainEventHandler<T> where T : IDomainEvent
{
    Task Handle(T domainEvent);
}
```

This allows you to create handlers for specific events:

```csharp
public class OrderPlacedHandler : IDomainEventHandler<OrderPlaced>
{
    public async Task Handle(OrderPlaced domainEvent)
    {
        // Logic to notify warehouse, send email, etc.
        Console.WriteLine($"Order {domainEvent.OrderId} placed at {domainEvent.PlacedAt}");
        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

---

## 🔄 How Domain Events Are Utilized

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how Domain Events are used in a Clean Architecture setup:

### 1. **Event Raised in Domain Layer**

Inside an aggregate (e.g., `Order`), you raise a domain event when something important happens:

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public List<IDomainEvent> DomainEvents { get; } = new();

    public void Place()
    {
        // Business logic
        DomainEvents.Add(new OrderPlaced(Id, DateTime.UtcNow));
    }
}
```

### 2. **Event Collected During Transaction**

The domain events are collected during the transaction (e.g., in a Unit of Work or DbContext).

### 3. **Event Dispatcher Triggers Handlers**

After the transaction is committed, a **Domain Event Dispatcher** (usually in the Infrastructure Layer) loops through the events and calls the appropriate handlers:

```csharp
public class DomainEventDispatcher
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;

    public async Task Dispatch(IEnumerable<IDomainEvent> events)
    {
        foreach (var domainEvent in events)
        {
            var handlerType = typeof(IDomainEventHandler<>).MakeGenericType(domainEvent.GetType());
            var handlers = _serviceProvider.GetServices(handlerType);

            foreach (var handler in handlers)
            {
                await ((Task)handler.GetType()
                    .GetMethod("Handle")
                    .Invoke(handler, new object[] { domainEvent }));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---
Let’s explore **Domain Services** with examples from both **Retail** and **Healthcare** domains to show how they encapsulate domain logic that doesn’t belong to a single entity.

---

## 🛒 Example: Retail Domain – Pricing Service

### Scenario:
You need to calculate the final price of a product based on discounts, taxes, and membership benefits. This logic involves multiple entities (Product, Customer, Promotion) and doesn’t belong to any one of them.

### Domain Service Interface:

```csharp
public interface IPricingService
{
    decimal CalculateFinalPrice(Product product, Customer customer);
}
```

### Implementation:

```csharp
public class PricingService : IPricingService
{
    public decimal CalculateFinalPrice(Product product, Customer customer)
    {
        decimal basePrice = product.Price;
        decimal discount = customer.IsPremiumMember ? 0.10m : 0.05m;
        decimal tax = 0.18m;

        decimal discountedPrice = basePrice - (basePrice * discount);
        return discountedPrice + (discountedPrice * tax);
    }
}
```

### Usage in Application Layer:

```csharp
public class CheckoutService
{
    private readonly IPricingService _pricingService;

    public CheckoutService(IPricingService pricingService)
    {
        _pricingService = pricingService;
    }

    public void Checkout(Product product, Customer customer)
    {
        var finalPrice = _pricingService.CalculateFinalPrice(product, customer);
        // Proceed with payment
    }
}
```

---

## 🏥 Example: Healthcare Domain – Appointment Scheduling Service

### Scenario:
You want to schedule an appointment ensuring the doctor is available, the patient has no conflicts, and the appointment complies with hospital policies.

### Domain Service Interface:

```csharp
public interface IAppointmentScheduler
{
    Appointment Schedule(Patient patient, Doctor doctor, DateTime dateTime);
}
```

### Implementation:

```csharp
public class AppointmentScheduler : IAppointmentScheduler
{
    public Appointment Schedule(Patient patient, Doctor doctor, DateTime dateTime)
    {
        if (!doctor.IsAvailable(dateTime))
            throw new Exception("Doctor not available");

        if (patient.HasConflict(dateTime))
            throw new Exception("Patient has a conflicting appointment");

        return new Appointment(patient.Id, doctor.Id, dateTime);
    }
}
```

### Usage in Application Layer:

```csharp
public class AppointmentService
{
    private readonly IAppointmentScheduler _scheduler;

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Explained Simply

### 1. **Introduction and Motivation**
- The video targets developers of all experience levels and aims to demystify DDD without jargon.
- Many online materials are advanced; this video explains DDD clearly, using a *drone delivery app* as an ongoing example.
- **Key point:** DDD helps align software closely with business needs by fostering communication between developers and domain experts (business people) for better quality, maintainable software.

### 2. **Two Main Parts of DDD**
#### A. **Strategic Design**
- **Focus:** The high-level, problem-space perspective of the domain/app.
- **Objective:** Understand the *value* the app offers, the *core problems* to solve, and discover domain knowledge.
- **Steps:**
  - **Identify Domain Experts:** Business stakeholders essential for knowledge gathering.
  - **Event Storming:** Collaborative sessions where all stakeholders use sticky notes to map events (e.g., “cart created,” “product removed”) and actions in the business process, helping everyone share a mental model.
  - **Ubiquitous Language:** Form a common vocabulary for all team members (e.g., “delivery method” not “delivery way”) to ensure clarity in both code and communication.
  - **Domain Analysis:** Grouping events into *core*, *supporting*, and *generic* subdomains.
      - *Core subdomain*: Central business value (e.g., “shipping” in a drone delivery app).
      - *Supporting/generic*: Areas that can use packages/APIs or be outsourced (e.g., payments, sales reports).

#### B. **Tactical Design**
- **Focus:** Technical/solution-space perspective, closer to coding and architecture.
- **Elements:**
  - **Bounded Contexts:** Logical system boundaries that often align with business subdomains but can span several.

    ```csharp
    // Example of a bounded context in C#
    namespace ShippingContext {
        public class Drone { /* Drone logic */ }
        public class Delivery { /* Delivery logic */ }
    }
    ```

  - **Entities:** Unique objects (e.g., Drone, Account), typically with IDs and mutable attributes.

    ```csharp
    public class Drone {
        public Guid Id { get; private set; }
        public string Model { get; private set; }
        public BatteryLevel Battery { get; private set; }

        public void AssignDelivery(Delivery delivery) {
            // Business logic
        }
    }
    ```

  - **Value Objects:** Small, immutable, value-based building blocks (e.g., battery level, status, email) without unique identity.

    ```csharp
    public class BatteryLevel {
        public int Percentage { get; }

        public BatteryLevel(int percentage) {
            if (percentage < 0 || percentage > 100)
                throw new ArgumentException("Invalid battery level");
            Percentage = percentage;
        }
    }
    ```

  - **Aggregates:** Groups of entities and value objects with a single *root entity*, which acts as a transaction boundary (ensuring changes to all members are committed together).

    ```csharp
    public class DeliveryAggregate {
        public Drone Drone { get; private set; }
        public Delivery Delivery { get; private set; }

        public void StartDelivery() {
            // Ensure both Drone and Delivery are updated together
        }
    }
    ```

  - **Repositories:** Abstraction layer for DB access, allowing you to persist/find entities without mixing logic and storage.

    ```csharp
    public interface IDroneRepository {
        Drone GetById(Guid id);
        void Save(Drone drone);
    }
    ```

  - **Services:**
      - *Domain Services*: Stateless business logic operations tied to entities (e.g., managing drone delivery rules).

        ```csharp
        public class DeliveryService {
            public void ScheduleDelivery(Drone drone, Delivery delivery) {
                // Business rules for scheduling
            }
        }
        ```

      - *Application Services*: Handle cross-domain needs like emailing, authentication.

        ```csharp
        public class NotificationService {
            public void SendDeliveryConfirmation(string email) {
                // Send email logic
            }
        }
        ```

  - **Domain Events:** Used for communicating changes (especially asynchronously) between bounded contexts (e.g., use RabbitMQ to inform “Shipping” that “Payment” is complete).

    ```csharp
    public class PaymentCompletedEvent {
        public Guid OrderId { get; }
        public DateTime Timestamp { get; }

        public PaymentCompletedEvent(Guid orderId) {
            OrderId = orderId;
            Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow;
        }
    }
    ```

  - **Inter-Context Communication:** Via integration events, shared resources, or anti-corruption layers.

### 3. **Architecture & Code Structure**
- Encourages using clean/object-oriented folder structures (e.g., entities, value objects, aggregates).
- You don’t need a rigid folder scheme; just organize logically by domain boundaries and keep object-oriented principles in mind.

    ```
    /ShippingContext
      /Entities
        Drone.cs
        Delivery.cs
      /ValueObjects
        BatteryLevel.cs
      /Aggregates
        DeliveryAggregate.cs
      /Repositories
        IDroneRepository.cs
      /Services
        DeliveryService.cs
    ```

### 4. **Anemic vs. Rich Domain Models**
- **Anemic Model:** Entities contain mostly primitive fields (IDs, strings), with little logic.
- **Rich Model:** Entities encapsulate logic, validations, and use value objects/interfaces, making them more powerful, clear, and maintainable.

    ```csharp
    // Rich model example
    public class Delivery {
        public Guid Id { get; private set; }
        public DeliveryStatus Status { get; private set; }

        public void MarkAsDelivered() {
            if (Status != DeliveryStatus.InTransit)
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot mark as delivered");
            Status = DeliveryStatus.Delivered;
        }
    }
    ```

### 5. **Key Example**
- The *drone delivery app* is dissected to demonstrate entities (Drone, Delivery), value objects (BatteryLevel, Status), aggregates (combining Drone, Delivery, etc.), and the use of domain events and services.

### 6. **Takeaways**
- **Strategic/tactical split** is the foundation: first, deeply understand the business; then, model your code to reflect it.
- Use *event storming* to gain comprehensive insight.
- Consistently use a *ubiquitous language* in code and business communication.
- Model and encapsulate complexity using entities, value objects, and aggregates.
- Keep domain logic close to where the data and events live; don’t scatter it in “services” or procedural utilities.

### 7. **Final Remarks**
- DDD can be adapted; you don’t need to slavishly follow every rule.
- The most important outcome is better communication, aligned mental models, and maintainable, expressive code.
- For questions, viewers are encouraged to comment for further clarification.

**This summary captures the step-by-step conceptual and practical wisdom from the video—applicable for any developer seeking to understand and apply Domain-Driven Design clearly and effectively, as explained by Software Developer Diaries**[1].

## 🗂️ Where Everything Goes in Clean Architecture

| Component                  | Layer         | Folder Example               |
|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| `IDomainEvent`            | Domain        | `Domain/Events`              |
| `OrderPlaced`             | Domain        | `Domain/Events`              |
| `Order` Aggregate         | Domain        | `Domain/Entities`            |
| `IDomainEventHandler<T>`  | Application   | `Application/EventHandlers`  |
| `OrderPlacedHandler`      | Application   | `Application/EventHandlers`  |
| `DomainEventDispatcher`   | Infrastructure| `Infrastructure/Events`      |

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach

- **Loose coupling** between domain logic and side effects.
- **Scalable**: Easily add new handlers without changing domain logic.
- **Testable**: Handlers can be unit tested independently.
- **Clear separation of concerns**.

## 🔍 Key Differences in Application Layer

| Feature                     | Clean Architecture                     | Onion Architecture                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Use Case Naming**        | Service-oriented (`OrderService`)      | Action-oriented (`PlaceOrder`)         |
| **Interface Role**         | Defines service contracts               | Defines use case contracts             |
| **Layer Focus**            | Application logic is central           | Domain logic is central                |
| **Validation Placement**   | Often abstracted into validators       | Can be inline or simple validators     |
| **Complexity**             | More abstraction, more interfaces      | Simpler, more direct                   |
| **Use Case Granularity**   | May group multiple actions in a service| One class per use case (SRP)           |

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Clean Architecture** uses **application services** to group related use cases and emphasizes **interface-driven design**.
- **Onion Architecture** treats each **use case as a first-class citizen**, often resulting in **one class per use case**, which aligns with **Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** principles.
