# Clean Arch

### Standard Guidelines

Clean Architecture is a popular approach to structuring your application. It splits the project into four layers:

1. **Domain**
2. **Application**
3. **Infrastructure**
4. **Presentation**

Each of these layers is typically one project in your solution.

### Domain Layer

The Domain layer sits at the core of the Clean Architecture. Here we define things like:

- Core business logic, entities, and domain-specific rules.
- Contains entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events, domain exceptions, repository interfaces.
- Interfaces defining domain services, constants, enums, events.

**Note**: The Domain layer is not allowed to reference other projects in your solution.

### Application Layer

The Application layer sits right above the Domain layer. It acts as an orchestrator for the Domain layer, containing the most important use cases in your application.

- Orchestrates the application's use cases or business logic.
- Contains application services and interfaces.
- Interacts with the Infrastructure layer and domain entities.
- Abstraction for Infrastructure services, DTOs, behaviors, mappings, application exceptions, commands, event handlers, queries.

You can structure your use cases using services or using commands and queries (optional).

In the Abstractions folder, define the interfaces required for the Application layer. The implementations for these interfaces are in one of the upper layers.

For every entity in the Domain layer, create one folder with the commands, queries, and events handlers.

### Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure layer contains implementations for external-facing services. This includes:

- Data access (repositories)
- Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Identity providers (e.g., Auth0, Keycloak)
- Emails providers
- Storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)
- Message queues (e.g., Rabbit MQ)

### Presentation Layer

The Presentation layer is the entry point to our system. Typically, you would implement this as a Web API project. The most important part of the Presentation layer is the Controllers, which define the API endpoints in our system.

### AI Prompt

1. Keep the domain model in the Domain layer.
2. Do not implement CQRS.
3. Connect to SQLServer.
4. This API will call some external APIs for data lookup and will call some services externally for saving the data.
5. Use Kafka for messaging.
6. Do not use email providers and storage services.
7. Use SSO for authentication and authorization.

Generate a folder structure for this

3. **Services**: Centralize API calls and business logic in the services folder.
4. **State Management**: Use actions, reducers, and a store for managing application state.
5. **Utilities**: Keep utility functions in a separate folder for reusability.
6. **Environment Variables**: Use a `.env` file for configuration and sensitive data.
7. **Documentation**: Include a `README.md` file to document the project setup and usage.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization using context and services. Use libraries like `react-router-dom` for protected routes and `jwt-decode` for handling JWT tokens.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track application behavior and errors.
- **Error Handling**: Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in the UI.
- **Security**: Ensure secure coding practices, such as avoiding inline styles and scripts, using HTTPS, and sanitizing user inputs.
- **Performance**: Optimize performance by using code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization techniques. Use tools like Lighthouse for performance audits.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization using context and services.
- **State Management**: Use actions, reducers, and a store for managing application state.
- **Micro UI**: Implement micro frontends if needed, using frameworks like `single-spa` or `Module Federation` in Webpack.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for components, services, and hooks using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

This structure and these guidelines should help you maintain a clean, organized, and scalable codebase, making it easier to manage and extend the application over time. This enhanced structure should help you maintain a clean, organized, and scalable codebase while adhering to industry best practices for authentication, authorization, security, performance, and micro UI.

===========================

### Cross-Cutting Concerns in any Applications

Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a software application that affect multiple components, making them difficult to isolate. These concerns often span across various layers and modules of an application, impacting its overall functionality and performance. Here are some common cross-cutting concerns:

1. **Logging**
   - **Purpose**: Capturing and storing logs for debugging, monitoring, and auditing purposes.

2. **Security**
   - **Purpose**: Implementing authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure communication protocols.

3. **Error Handling**
   - **Purpose**: Managing exceptions and errors in a consistent manner across the application.

4. **Performance**
   - **Purpose**: Optimizing the application's performance through caching, load balancing, and efficient resource management.

5. **Transaction Management**
   - **Purpose**: Ensuring data consistency and integrity, especially in distributed systems.

6. **Monitoring and Metrics**
   - **Purpose**: Tracking the application's health, performance, and usage statistics.

7. **Configuration Management**
   - **Purpose**: Managing application settings and configurations in a centralized manner.

8. **Data Validation**
   - **Purpose**: Ensuring that data entering the system meets predefined criteria and constraints.

9. **Internationalization and Localization**
   - **Purpose**: Adapting the application to support multiple languages and regional settings.

10. **Caching**
    - **Purpose**: Storing frequently accessed data in memory to improve performance.

11. **Auditing**
    - **Purpose**: Keeping track of user actions and changes within the application for compliance and security purposes.

12. **Communication with External Systems**
    - **Purpose**: Handling interactions with external APIs and services.

13. **Concurrency and Synchronization**
    - **Purpose**: Managing access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment.

14. **Privacy**
    - **Purpose**: Ensuring that user data is handled in compliance with privacy regulations and standards.

Addressing these cross-cutting concerns effectively can lead to a more secure, maintainable, and performant application.
