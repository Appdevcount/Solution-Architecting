Absolutely, Siraj! Here's a comprehensive and practical System Design Evaluation Checklist tailored for application-level architecture. Each item includes reasoning so you can use it to assess designs during interviews, reviews, or planning sessions. You can easily convert this into an Excel sheet with columns like Checklist Item, Category, Why It Matters, Evaluation Notes, and Score (1â€“5).

âœ… System Design Evaluation Checklist

| # | Checklist Item | Category | Why It Matters |
|---|----------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Define Functional Requirements | Requirements | Ensures clarity on what the system must do. Avoids scope creep. |
| 2 | Define Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) | Requirements | Covers scalability, latency, availability, etc.â€”critical for architecture decisions. |
| 3 | Identify Core Components & Services | Architecture | Helps visualize modularity and separation of concerns. |
| 4 | Choose Appropriate Architecture Style (Monolith, Microservices, Serverless) | Architecture | Impacts scalability, maintainability, and deployment strategy. |
| 5 | Data Flow & Control Flow Diagrams | Architecture | Clarifies how data moves and where logic resides. |
| 6 | Database Design (Relational vs NoSQL) | Data | Aligns with access patterns, consistency, and scalability needs. |
| 7 | Caching Strategy (Redis, CDN, etc.) | Performance | Reduces latency and load on backend systems. |
| 8 | Load Balancing Strategy | Scalability | Ensures even traffic distribution and fault tolerance. |
| 9 | Rate Limiting & Throttling | Security & Reliability | Prevents abuse and protects backend resources. |
| 10 | Authentication & Authorization (OAuth, JWT, etc.) | Security | Secures access and enforces user roles. |
| 11 | API Design (REST, GraphQL) | Interface | Impacts client integration, versioning, and developer experience. |
| 12 | Data Consistency Model (Strong, Eventual, etc.) | Data | Influences user experience and system complexity. |
| 13 | Scalability Strategy (Horizontal, Vertical) | Scalability | Determines how the system handles growth. |
| 14 | Availability & Fault Tolerance (Replication, Failover) | Reliability | Ensures uptime and resilience to failures. |
| 15 | Monitoring & Observability (Logs, Metrics, Tracing) | Operations | Enables debugging, performance tuning, and alerting. |
| 16 | Disaster Recovery Plan | Reliability | Prepares for data loss, outages, and restores service quickly. |
| 17 | Deployment Strategy (CI/CD, Blue-Green, Canary) | DevOps | Reduces downtime and risk during releases. |
| 18 | Tech Stack Justification | Architecture | Ensures choices are aligned with goals and team expertise. |
| 19 | Cost Estimation & Optimization | Business | Helps balance performance with budget constraints. |
| 20 | Compliance & Data Privacy (GDPR, HIPAA) | Security & Legal | Avoids legal issues and protects user data. |

ðŸ§  Tips for Using This in Excel

- Add columns for Evaluation Notes, Score (1â€“5), and Risk Level (Low/Medium/High).
- Use conditional formatting to highlight weak areas.
- Create filters by category (e.g., Security, Performance, Architecture).
- Add a summary sheet to visualize total score and risk distribution.
