This format gives you a powerful tool to evaluate systems, compare trade-offs, and make architecture decisions with clarity. Since I can‚Äôt generate downloadable files directly in this mode, you can copy this table into Excel and apply dropdowns, scoring logic, and conditional formatting.

If you‚Äôd like, I can walk you through setting up formulas, filters, or a dashboard summary in Excel next. Or tailor this sheet for a specific domain like fintech, healthcare, or SaaS.Architecture
