# Rationale and Situation

## Rationale Note from Dave Hausler

Situation

LeanIX was purchased at the request of Noelle Eder. The work has been conducted as a collaboration between Eric Reed and DP Koka.

Our Cigna Enterprise Architects are engaged in established a TOGAF based view of the overall enterprise leveraging LeanIX. Below is a very brief review of the overall set of topics.

TOGAF [The Open Group Architecture Framework] is a globally recognized enterprise architecture standard. It is a ubiquitous best practice for defining, documenting and communicating an overall business and its technologies.

Ultimately, TOGAF via LeanIX provides a strong set of tools to document and analyze the overall Cigna business and architecture. It includes a wide range of subjects and methods: Business Capabilities, Processes, Projects, Data Objects, Applications, Goals and more. This type of analysis, documentation and repository enables improved communications and shared perspectives and understandings. TOGAF and LeanIX are often used by Enterprise Architects and Executives to make key decisions on future direction, business changes, technology changes and the consolidation of functions and functionality.

Building a unified knowledge base and understanding of our overall organization requires a structured and disciplined approach. Multiple enterprise goals, such as Project Dawn and Drive to 20205 rely on a unified and shared understanding. LeanIX goals and purpose are at the core of creating a more singular view of our overall enterprise. Increasingly the information in LeanIX is and will be used to make key strategic decisions.

## Problem

Today (May 2024), Evicore products and capabilities are poorly and underrepresented in LeanIX. In addition, much of the overall Cigna organization sees Evicore as a “black box”, as described by Enterprise Architect Ellen Anderson. This can put Evicore at a strategic disadvantage as decisions are discussed, planned and made.

## Implication

The risk at hand is that Evicore products and capabilities could be unknown, overlooked or worse shuttered due to a poor understanding of the Evicore business and the value we provide. In the absence of solid information being provided via LeanIX Leaders and Enterprise Architecture could see our products and capabilities as duplicative or irrelevant. It is true some duplicative solutions across overall Cigna do exist; however, it is critical for Evicore to provide a description of its differentiation where such exists.

## Needed Payoff

We need to execute an effort to more fully and more accurately define and describe Evicore Products and Capabilities via the TOGAF structure being used in LeanIX. We have at our disposal some solid foundations for this work:

- The “TrueNorth” Final Report created released in July 2021 can provide an initial foundation
- The Product and Planning organization is currently engaged in work to define our key Products
- The Evicore Integration project (Project Dawn) has established a strong list of our technical solutions and landscape. The current list includes approximately 150 technical solutions leveraged across Evicore.

It is suggested funding from the Evicore Integration project be leveraged to support the work associated to LeanIX and Evicore.

## General Notes

We need to formally model the vertical and horizontal roadmaps in LeanIX in order to:

- Coordinate investment priorities with our business partners before work begins
- Coordinate across the roadmaps from intake through operations
- Keep “score” and determine when we reach transformative thresholds in our business & technology strategy that enable business value delivery

What’s in a roadmap? Some details can be found in Confluence here:

Playbook for creating a roadmap in LeanIX - Chief Architecture Office - Confluence (cigna.com)

By doing this work, we create the opportunity for each roadmap to be dynamic, evolving and visible to other Enterprise Architects, and other organizations across business and technology, in ways that static power point presentations cannot achieve.

Having all roadmaps formally modeled in LeanIX ensures that we know what we’re talking about when we use overloaded concepts (like “Care Management”), as well as achieving consistency with concepts in external systems like Jira, ServiceNow, and Pathfinder, and more.
