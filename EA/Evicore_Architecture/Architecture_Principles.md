### What are Architecture principles?

Teams need to act small and think big. Architecture principles are meant to provide a contextual framework around allowing teams who are innovating to solve for the now while aligning for the future. While solutions and strategy may change more often, Architecture principles are meant to be strategic and not tactical.
