Our Cigna Enterprise Architects are engaged in established a TOGAF based view of the overall enterprise leveraging LeanIX. Below is a very brief review of the overall set of topics.

### TOGAF [The Open Group Architecture Framework]

TOGAF is a globally recognized enterprise architecture standard. It is a ubiquitous best practice for defining, documenting and communicating an overall business and its technologies.

Ultimately, TOGAF via LeanIX provides a strong set of tools to document and analyze the overall Cigna business and architecture. It includes a wide range of subjects and methods: Business Capabilities, Processes, Projects, Data Objects, Applications, Goals and more.

This type of analysis, documentation and repository enables improved communications and shared perspectives and understandings. TOGAF and LeanIX are often used by Enterprise Architects and Executives to make key decisions on future direction, business changes, technology changes and the consolidation of functions and functionality.

TOGAF offers a solution by helping businesses to establish clear ROIs, solid lines of communication, and enough shared perspective to tie everything together in successful enterprise transformation initiatives.
